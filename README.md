#### AWS JIT and Bring your Own Certificate Demo.

### Introduction
[AWS IoT](http://aws.amazon.com/iot/) is a service that will allow internet of things (IoT) devices to be easily and securely connected to Amazon Web Services (AWS).  The Microchip __AWS-IoT-Zero-Touch__ solution provides the following key features:

1. Secure the communication of any AWS IoT node regardless of the Microcontroller or Processor used
2. Accelerate the cryptographic algorithms of the TLS (Transport Layer Security) layer and isolate them in a secure Trusted Execution Environment
3. Remove all manipulation of keys and certificates throughout any step of the end node manufacturing. It makes the manufacturing of AWS IoT end nodes "Zero Touch" from a security viewpoint.

This solution requires multiple hardware and software elements:

- A Secure AWS IoT end node development kit: [AT88CKECC-AWS-XSTK](http://www.atmel.com/tools/AT88CKECC-AWS-XSTK.aspx)
- A desktop application to configure an AWS IoT development kit: [Application GUI](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/AWS-Secure-Insight/tree/master/sw)

The development kit ships with all firmware pieces pre-programmed. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/AWS-Secure-Insight/tree/master/sw)

<b>Please read the step by step user guide first!</b>
